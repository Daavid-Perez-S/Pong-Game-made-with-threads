# Pong-Game-made-with-threads
It's a classic game called and known as "Pong", it was manufactured originally by Atari in 1972, based in table tennis sports.

I know that around the world there're many programs like this, I mean, this game already was programed by others people before, but the the main difference between this and the others games is this was made with **"Threads"**, just that  ^^.

>So...If you have questions or suggestions, the program has bugs or something else, you can ask me or let me a commentary.
Thanks.
